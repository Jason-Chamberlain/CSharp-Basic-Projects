# Strings and Integers with Try-Catch Blocks
Welcome to the Strings and Integers with Try-Catch application, demonstrating essential concepts related to handling user input and exceptions. By running this program, you'll gain insights into collecting and processing data while implementing error handling strategies.

## Program Overview
The Strings and Integers with Try-Catch program focuses on two critical aspects:

1. **User Input and Conversion**: It prompts the user to input an integer divisor and converts the input to an integer for further processing.

1. **Exception Handling**: The program incorporates a try-catch block to handle potential exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the program does not crash due to unexpected inputs or errors.

## Key Concepts

- **List of Integers**: The program begins with a predefined list of integers (`numList`).

- **User Input**: It prompts the user to enter a divisor, expecting a non-zero whole number.

- **Try-Catch Block**: The heart of the program is the try-catch block that surrounds the division operation. This block is crucial for managing exceptions that may occur during execution.

- **Exception Handling**: The catch block captures any exceptions that might arise, such as division by zero or invalid input, and provides informative error messages to the user.

- **Displaying Results**: The program iterates through each number in the list and divides it by the user-provided divisor. It then displays the result or error message.

- **Finally Block**: The program concludes with a finally block, ensuring that the program waits for user input before exiting, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

## Conclusion
This application offers valuable insights into working with user input and implementing robust exception handling strategies in C#. Exception handling is a fundamental aspect of software development, ensuring that programs can gracefully recover from errors and provide meaningful feedback to users. By running this program and experimenting with various inputs, you'll enhance your understanding of these essential concepts, preparing you for more complex C# development tasks.
