# Looping and Collection Manipulation
This README provides an overview of the Looping and Collection Manipulation program, which focuses on teaching fundamental concepts related to loops and collections in C#, offering hands-on experience with arrays and lists. Let's explore the core concepts covered in this solution.

## Program Overview
The Looping and Collection Manipulation program demonstrates how to work with arrays and lists in C#, showcasing different looping techniques to process data within these collections. Specifically, it covers the use of `for` loops and `foreach` loops to iterate through elements and perform specific actions based on conditions.

##Key Concepts Covered
The program introduces several key concepts of C# programming:

1. **Arrays**: Arrays are statically sized collections of elements of the same data type. The program uses an integer array `testScores` to store and process test scores.

1. **`for` Loop**: The program employs `for` loops to iterate through arrays, allowing the examination of each element and the application of conditional logic to filter specific values. In this case, it identifies passing test scores (scores above 85).

1. **`foreach` Loop**: The program also utilizes `foreach` loops to iterate through lists. It demonstrates how to traverse a list of integers (`testScores1`) and a list of strings (`names`) and apply logic based on the elements' values.

1. **Lists**: Lists are dynamically sized collections in C#. The program uses `List<int>` and `List<string>` to store and manipulate data.

1. **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements are employed within loops to filter and process data based on specific conditions. The program determines passing test scores and counts them using `if` statements.

1. **Collection Manipulation**: The program showcases how to manipulate collections, such as adding elements to a list (`testScores1`) and creating a new list (`passingScores`) based on specific criteria.

1. **Console Output**: It uses `Console.WriteLine()` to display messages and processed data to the console, aiding in understanding the program's logic and results.

## Conclusion
The Looping and Collection Manipulation program provides a practical and interactive introduction to essential C# programming concepts related to loops, arrays, lists, and conditional statements. By working with real data and applying logic, one gains a solid understanding of how to process and manipulate collections in C#. This program serves as a foundational building block for those looking to develop their skills in C# programming and data manipulation.
