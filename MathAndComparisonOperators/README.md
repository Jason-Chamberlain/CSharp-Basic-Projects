# Math and Comparison Operators
This README provides an overview of the Math and Comparison Operators program, which focuses on teaching essential concepts related to mathematical operations and comparison operators in C#, offering a hands-on experience for learners.

## Program Overview
The Math and Comparison Operators program is designed to demonstrate and practice using various mathematical operations and comparison operators in C#. It allows users to perform arithmetic calculations and compare values to understand how these operators work.

## Key Concepts Covered
The program introduces several fundamental concepts of C# programming:

1. **Mathematical Operators**: It showcases the use of arithmetic operators, including addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`), for performing mathematical calculations.

1. **Variables**: The program uses variables to store and manipulate numeric values, demonstrating how to declare and assign values to variables.

1. **Data Types**: It employs different data types, such as `int` and `double`, to handle integer and floating-point numbers, respectively.

1. **String Concatenation**: The program illustrates string concatenation, which involves combining string and numeric values to create informative output messages.

1. **Comparison Operators**: It explores comparison operators like greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), less than or equal to (`<=`), equality (`==`), and inequality (`!=`) to compare values and generate Boolean results.

1. **Boolean Variables**: The program introduces boolean variables (bool) to store and manipulate true/false values, enabling logical comparisons.

1. **Console Output**: It uses `Console.WriteLine()` to display results and messages in the console, helping users visualize the program's output.

## Conclusion
The Math and Comparison Operators program offers a practical and interactive way to grasp essential concepts related to mathematical operations and comparison operators in C#. It serves as a foundational learning resource for beginners to understand how to perform calculations and make logical comparisons within C# programs. By working with this program, one can build a strong foundation for more advanced C# development and problem-solving tasks.
