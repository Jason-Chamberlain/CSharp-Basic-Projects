# "Hello, World!" Program
This README provides an overview of the "Hello, World!" program, created to introduce beginners to the essentials of C# programming. In this guide, we will explore the key concepts learned through this simple yet instructive program.

## Program Overview
The "Hello, World!" program's primary objective is to display the phrase "Hello, World!" on the console.

## Key Concepts Covered
Despite its simplicity, the "Hello, World!" program introduces fundamental concepts that are the building blocks of C# and many other programming languages. These key concepts include:

- **Using System Namespace**: The program utilizes the `using System;` directive to include the System namespace. This namespace provides access to the Console class and its methods, allowing for console input and output operations.

- **The Main Method**: The entry point of any C# console application is the `Main` method. This method is automatically executed when the program is run. In this program, we observe how the `static void Main()` method is defined, serving as the starting point for code execution.

- **Console Output**: The `Console.WriteLine()` method is employed to display the "Hello, World!" message on the console. This showcases how to produce output in the console window, making it visible to the user.

- **User Interaction**: The program employs `Console.ReadLine()` to wait for user input. This concept is introduced to keep the console window open, allowing users to view the output until they press the Enter key. This technique is often used to prevent the console window from closing immediately after program execution.

## Conclusion
While the "Hello, World!" program is incredibly simple, it lays the foundation for understanding essential concepts in C# programming. Concepts such as namespaces, methods, console output, and user interaction are introduced in a straightforward and approachable manner. This program serves as a crucial starting point for individuals embarking on their journey into C# development, providing a glimpse into the syntax and structure of C# applications.
