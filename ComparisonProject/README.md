# Comparison Project
This README presents an overview of a C# solution that emphasized the fundamental concepts of user input, data comparison, and conditional statements. The "Comparison Project" was designed to calculate and compare the annual salaries of two individuals based on their hourly rates and hours worked per week.

## Overview of the Solution
The "Comparison Project" is an interactive program where information about two individuals (referred to as Person 1 and Person 2) is collected, and their annual salaries are calculated. Subsequently, a comparison is made between the annual salaries of these individuals, and a determination is reached regarding whether Person 1's income exceeds that of Person 2. Here are the key features and concepts that are demonstrated in this solution:

### 1. Handling User Input
- Input from users is solicited for the hourly rate and hours worked per week for both Person 1 and Person 2. This showcases the process of data collection by means of the console.
### 2. Execution of Arithmetic Operations
- The solution employs basic arithmetic operations (multiplication) to calculate the annual salaries of Person 1 and Person 2 based on their hourly rates and hours worked per week. This underscores the concept of executing calculations in C#.
### 3. Data Comparison
- Conditional statements are utilized to compare the annual salaries of Person 1 and Person 2. The solution assesses whether Person 1's annual salary is greater than that of Person 2.
## Key Concepts Acquired
The "Comparison Project" furnishes learners with essential knowledge and skills related to user input, data processing, and conditional statements in C#. Key takeaways from this solution include:

- **User Interaction**: An understanding of how users can be interacted with by presenting prompts and collecting input data from the console.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Familiarity with the execution of mathematical operations, such as multiplication, for the purpose of calculating values.

- **Conditional Statements**: The application of conditional statements (`if`) to compare data and make decisions based on the outcomes of these comparisons.

## Conclusion
The "Comparison Project" furnishes a practical illustration of the process of gathering user input, conducting calculations, and executing data comparisons within a C# program. These fundamental concepts constitute a significant foundation for constructing interactive applications and making informed decisions. The skills acquired through this solution have applicability across a spectrum of scenarios, rendering it a valuable educational experience for C# developers.
