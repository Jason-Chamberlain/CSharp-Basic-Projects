# Number Guessing Game
This README provides an overview of the Number Guessing Game program, focusing on teaching essential concepts related to loops, conditional statements, and user input handling, providing an interactive experience for users to guess a number.

## Program Overview
The Number Guessing Game program is a simple interactive application that challenges users to guess a predefined number. It demonstrates the use of loops, switches, and conditional statements in C# to create an engaging user experience.

Key Concepts Covered
The program introduces several key concepts of C# programming:

1. **User Input**: It uses `Console.ReadLine()` to read user input from the console, allowing users to input their guessed numbers.

1. **`do-while` Loop**: The core of the game is implemented using a `do-while` loop. This loop repeatedly prompts the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed.

1. **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements, including `if`, `switch`, and `case`, are employed to evaluate the user's input and determine whether it matches the correct number.

1. **Boolean Variables**: A boolean variable `isGuessed` is used to control the game loop's exit condition. The game continues until `isGuessed` becomes `true`.

1. **User Feedback**: The program provides feedback to the user after each guess, informing them whether their guess is correct or incorrect.

1. **Repetition**: Users are allowed to make multiple guesses, and the program gives them the opportunity to try again if their guess is incorrect.

1. **Console Output**: It uses `Console.WriteLine()` to display messages and feedback to the user in the console, enhancing the user's understanding of the game's progress.

## Conclusion
The Number Guessing Game program offers an interactive and engaging way to learn fundamental C# programming concepts, including loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and Boolean variables. It serves as an excellent starting point for beginners to practice these concepts while enjoying a simple and fun game. This project provides a foundation for further exploration of C# programming and the development of more complex applications.
