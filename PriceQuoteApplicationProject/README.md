# Package Express Shipping Calculator
This README provides an overview of the Package Express Shipping Calculator, designed to help users calculate shipping costs for packages based on their weight and dimensions, while also ensuring that packages meet certain size and weight criteria.

## Program Overview
The Package Express Shipping Calculator is a practical application that serves as an excellent example of a real-world use case for C# programming. It guides users through the process of providing package details and calculates the estimated shipping cost, considering weight and dimensions. Additionally, it checks whether the package exceeds maximum size or weight limits and provides appropriate messages to the user.

## Key Concepts Covered
This program covers several key concepts related to C# programming:

- **Console Input**: The program uses `Console.ReadLine()` to capture user input from the console, such as weight, width, height, and length of the package.

- **Conditional Statements**: It demonstrates the use of `if` statements to check conditions, such as whether the weight or size of the package exceeds specified limits, and provides appropriate responses.

- **Variable Usage**: The program showcases the declaration and usage of various variables to store and manipulate data, including integers for weight, dimensions, size, and shipping cost.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: It utilizes arithmetic operations to calculate the shipping cost based on the provided package details.

- **String Concatenation**: The program shows how to concatenate (combine) strings to form informative messages displayed to the user.

## Conclusion
The Package Express Shipping Calculator demonstrates how C# can be used to create practical applications for everyday tasks. By running and exploring this program, one will gain valuable experience in handling user input, performing calculations, and using conditional statements.
