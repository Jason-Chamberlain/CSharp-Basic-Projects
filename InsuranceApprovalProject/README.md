# Insurance Approval Checker
This README provides an overview of the Insurance Approval Checker program, which focuses on introducing essential C# programming concepts and decision-making based on user input. Let's explore the core concepts covered in this solution.

## Program Overview
The Insurance Approval Checker program is designed to determine whether a user is eligible for insurance coverage based on specific criteria, including age, DUI history, and the number of speeding tickets. The program prompts users for input and then evaluates whether they qualify for insurance, displaying the result.

## Key Concepts Covered
The program introduces several key concepts of C# programming:

- **Using System Namespace**: The program includes the `using System;` directive, which allows access to the `System` namespace and its essential classes for input and output operations.

- **User Input**: It demonstrates how to prompt users for input using `Console.WriteLine()` to display messages and `Console.ReadLine()` to read user responses. The input is parsed and stored as different data types, such as integers and booleans.

- **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements, specifically `if` statements, are used to make decisions based on user input. The program employs conditional logic to determine if the user is eligible for insurance.

- **Boolean Logic**: The program utilizes boolean variables (`bool`) to represent conditions such as age greater than 15, the absence of a DUI history, and the number of speeding tickets being less than or equal to 3. These conditions are combined to determine insurance eligibility.

- **Console Output**: The result of the insurance eligibility check is displayed to the user using `Console.WriteLine()`. The program communicates whether the user is qualified for insurance based on the calculated boolean value.

## Conclusion
The Insurance Approval Checker program provides an engaging introduction to core C# programming concepts, including user input, conditional statements, boolean logic, and console output. By simulating real-world decision-making processes, it helps one understand how to structure basic C# applications and make informed decisions based on user input. This program serves as a foundational building block for those beginning their journey into C# programming.
